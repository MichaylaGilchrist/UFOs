# UFOs
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to develop a webpage that will filter out UFO sitings throughout the United States and Canada. It shows various facts about the sitings like date, location, shape of siting, duration, and any comments that the person made. 
## Results
In order to dig through the data our client wanted to add five different filters: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. These filters will allow the website visitor to see and possibly trend data on their own.

In order to search one simply has to type in their request into one of the many filter input boxes. If you would like to filter by one item just fill in one input box and click outside the input box.

To filter by another variable just fill in a second input box to further narrow down the search. Don't forget to click outside of the input box.

![UFO_Filters_shape](https://github.com/MichaylaGilchrist/UFOs/blob/main/UFO_Filters_shape.PNG)

In order to return to the full data set just remove all inputs from the input boxes.

## Summary 
One drawback of this webpage design is the website visitor will have to have previous knowledge of dates or cities that sitings have taken place or else they'll need to scroll through the entire dataset to get an idea. Further recommendations could be to add a map that can highlight the cities. Another improvement would be to add drop down filters to some of the filters like date or shape. A third recommendation would be to add a filter button in to ease the website user experience.
